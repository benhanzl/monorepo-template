This is a personal template repository tailored to my specific workflow and preferences.

That said, if you spot bugs, typos, or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or PR. Just keep in mind that I may not accept changes that conflict with my personal preferences or use cases.

Thanks for your interest!
